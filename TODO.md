# TODO: Fix Admin Layout and Verify App Functionality

## Steps to Complete:

1. **[x] Edit resources/views/admin/layout/main.blade.php**: Increase padding-top on the wrapper div from `pt-16` to `pt-20` to prevent content overlap with the fixed header.

2. **Run Laravel development server**: Execute `php artisan serve` to start the application on localhost:8000.

3. **Verify in browser**: Use browser_action to launch the app, navigate to home and admin pages, confirm no overlaps and functionality works.

4. **Check all custom files**: Ensure controllers, models, migrations, and views load without errors; seed data if needed for testing.

5. **Complete task**: Confirm the app runs directly as requested.
